            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm a finance and investment technology professional with over a decade of experience in financial systems, general ledger processes, and system implementations. Currently, I work as a Principal Configuration Engineer for Investment Technology, where I manage financial system configurations, reconcile investment data, and ensure smooth integration between technology platforms and corporate financial processes. Throughout my career at Liberty Mutual, I've taken on progressively senior roles in Investment Operations and Investment Finance, leading system migrations, process automation, and financial reconciliation efforts. I've played a key role in implementing general ledger solutions like Microsoft Dynamics AX and Simcorp, helping to improve efficiency and data accuracy across the organization. I earned a Master of Professional Accountancy and a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Bryant University, with a concentration in Accounting and a minor in Applied Psychology. With a strong mix of financial expertise, system knowledge, and a passion for process improvement, I thrive at the intersection of investment technology and accounting.</p>
